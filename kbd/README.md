Installed using [usevia.app](https://usevia.app). As of early 2026 it only works on Chromium-based browsers and they can't be snaps. Once you've loaded in the current json file (which you probably don't need to do, since via recognizes the S1), you can change keys in the appropriate layer (2/3 are for linux) and they should be instantly updated. If you make changes, save the updated json file.
